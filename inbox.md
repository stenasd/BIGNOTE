# [refactoring](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method)
## technical dept
happens when time is a factor and quality vs time is a tradeoff
## Causes of technical debt
- bad managment or buissnes pressure
- no testing or bad test
- bad components changes in one part breaks other parts

## When to refactor
rule of three
- first time 
- when doing something similar a second time cringe
- 3d time start refactor

## How to refactor
- code should be cleaner
- no new features 
- all test should past after

# code smell
methods and classes that's gotten to big so they are hard to work with
## bloaters
- to big methods thats over 10 lines should be questioned if there is a need to comment a method you should take this code to new method. key is good names for exact feature
- to big classes with to many methods. when class is wearing to many hats split it up.
