## anal techniq
### Basic Static Analysis 
examin exe without viewing instructions. confirm that file is malisc or get network signature

### Basic dynamic anal
running malware and observ. to remove infection. produce signatures. to do need to setup an enviroment to do safet

### Advance Static Analysis 
loading exe into dissassembler and looking at instructions to get grasp at what it do.
### Advance dynamic anal
internal state of running exe used to get info that cant get with static.
## types of malware
### backdoor
Malicious code that installs itself onto a computer to allow
the attacker access. Backdoors usually let the attacker connect to the
computer with little or no authentication and execute commands on the
local system.
### botnet 
like backdoor but all infected gets same instructions from single hivemind
### Downloader
only to download other malic code. installed after control of syttem
### info stealing malw
collect info and send to attacker sniffers password grabbers and keylogger.
### launcher 
used to start other malic. nontrad techniq to ensure stealth or greater accses to system
### rootkit
malic code to conceal existance of other malw.
### scareware 
sacer/trick user into buying stuff
### spam sending malw
uses machine to send spam
### worm or virus
copy to other comp

## antivirus scanning
run antivirus to see if it has it in db
virustotal.com to upload and get data if its common

## hashing
get uniq id for file. md5 and sha-1 to get hash.
## string scan
shows text like urls and paths. End is null terminator to declare string is over. by reading strings can get info what it purpuse is from error prints.
## packing files
unpackes when started and when analysed staticly only small wrapper can be dissected.
## Detecting packers with PEiD
used to detect if exe is packed or compiler employed to build an application. https://upx.github.io/
## portable executable file format
format can reaveal a lot. PE file is used by windows exe object code and dll. the pe file format is a data structe that got data for windows os to manage wrapped exe code. begin with header that got info aobut the code and type of applic, library functions and space req. pe header is great value 
# linked libraries and functions 
most usseful is fucntion imports. connected by linking. 
## static runtime and dynamic linking
> static linked: all code is copied into exe own code. hard to know if its from library

> runtime and dll : common in malware only when needed it connect to library

> windows function allowed for linked LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress. LdrGetProcAddress and LdrLoadDll. loadlibrary and gerprocaddress allow program to accses any function in any library on pc.
> dll writes used info to pe file and all functions and library.
## exploring dynamically linked functions with dep walk
https://www.dependencywalker.com/
used to look at pe header and see dll funcitons and library
### naming conventions
when evaluation unfamiliar windows funcitons. old versions of func got ex before. func that takes string param include a or a w at the end of their name. one for ascii and one for wide char.
## PE header
> .text : section with code that can execute

> .rdata contains import and export data

> .data global data wich is accs from entire program.

> .rsrc resources icon images and menus
