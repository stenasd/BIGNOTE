Ethics has nothing to with it. The world's not a John Lennon song. It's a cruel place; there has always been wars and there will always be wars. It seems ridiculous to think Russia should feel threatened by NATO. But it isn't NATO per se that Russia is worried about. Ir's Nestle and Big Pharma and McDonald's and Google and Proctor and Gamble. Who's really free, you with your insulin marked up 1900 per cent and shitty paying job and media owned by six companies, or the typical Russian citizen? And you want to talk about ethics? Yes there has been death. But who has killed more people this year, the Russian military or the American health care system? The Russians see that if they don't act now, in fifty years they, like you, won't be citizens of a country but employees of a vast soulless machine. Fuck your "ethical".
