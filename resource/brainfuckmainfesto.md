25 years and feels like life is already over. im **morbidly obese** hugless virgin. Recent memory of being sexualy abused when I was 11-12 in a cheap hostel in latvia my dad left me at. Was often left at the hostel when I went with my dad when he traveled.
It happens when a mid 30 man started climbing into other ppls bed. he entered my bed and started touching me. eventually the hostel owner entered the dorm and for some reason i still don't get they left after talking to one of the persons in the dorm. All this came back to me when i was watching a debate about pedofilia. It was said that often when someone is fantasizing about being a child and having relationship to a older person. in my case i like porn about [redacted]. Ofc its all in "hentai" form and nothing thats illegal i think. Recent this has been the reason and the fact i have been trying to improve and cant is the reason about a lot of recent suicidal thought.
 
I remember about mom and dad fighting. why i cant remember but this happened when i was 14. I remember mother coming crying to me and she wants to move away and wants help. i denied her and told me i want to stay with dad and she should as well. After that fighting and atmosphere got worse. I deeply regret not going with her and that might have saved her if her cause of death was sucide and not a freak accident.
 
**why am i so fat.** i cant remember ever being a healthy weight always flagpole high bmi for other in same age. Always been the fattest compared to other children. Always had been smelly and had a bad hygiene. I have been think why and how i got so fat. if i have been obese since a child it cant be something i did wrong. at least that early in my life there was nothing i could have done and my sister was a healthy weight and ate the same food and the same after school activity. I was bullied since the day i started in preschool(heard about being bullied by russian cousins before that but got no memory of it). It only really stopped when i entered highschool. My sister was as well but not in the same extent. It really is a mystery to me atleast that young. After highschool i had more control and peer pressure on losing weight. Never took it serious until 9th grade. after that i have been trying but keep failing year after year.
    another theory to why is that i spent a lot of time more with my dad and he had an influence on what i ate. I remember eating fast food a lot with him but usually the cheapest thing on the menu just to have a reason to sit at the restaurant. At the end i agree that after i exited middle school i should have been able to figure it out.
