green rock mine deep under ground. green rock needed to fuel new super construct high end tech. 
volt inc is sabotaging mine to drop company price and w8 for full buyout.
Strike in the mine about conditions after doing clockwork golems work.
Demands: free passage to the overworld. Pay in real money. Remove disease on all sick workers

big elevator down to small miner town. Ticket up is payed in tokens and most of workers are "slaves". A lot of sick workers after clockworks cant do gruntwork and move green rocks.
